### Indexable skiplist in C++, Python, Java - ordered set with O(log n) SEARCH BY RANK, lookup, insertion, and deletion. 
Implementation of the indexable skiplist data structure from scratch. Source of the algorithm: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list) and [description by the original author](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.17.524&rep=rep1&type=pdf). Skiplist operates similarly to `std::multiset` but also supports `O(log n)` lookup of the given value by it's rank (ie, what is the Nth smallest element?" or "what is the rank of element with key=X"). This function is absent in majority of available packages. Essentially skiplist is a composition linked lists where nodes are assigned random heights. That allows to skip some elements during traversal and achieve faster performance, O(log n) instead of O(n). Nodes are also assigned "pointer lengths" to keep track of the rank. 
To fill the `SetSkiplist` with 10^5 elements typically takes 10 times longer than to fill `std::multiset`, however, lookup by rank operates as fast or even faster than `std::set find()`.
